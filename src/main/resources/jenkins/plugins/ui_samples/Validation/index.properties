blurb.context=\
  Form field validation can access values of the nearby input controls, which is useful for performing \
  complex context sensitive form validation.
blurb.otheruse=\
  The same technique can be also used for auto-completion, populating combobox/listbox, and so on.
blurb.contrived=\
  The example below is bit contrived, but all the input elements are named 'name' (for city name and state name), \
  and we use <code>@RelativePath</code> so that the validation of the state name refers to the capital name, \
  and the validation of the city name refers to the state name.
