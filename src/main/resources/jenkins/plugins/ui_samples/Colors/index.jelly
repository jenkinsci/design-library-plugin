    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use color to draw attention to important parts of your interface</li>
      <li>Color shouldn't be the only way a piece of information is conveyed, use text or symbols along with it</li>
      <li>It's best to use colors provided by Jenkins as they will automatically adapt to the user's theme</li>
    </ul>
