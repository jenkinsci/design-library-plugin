    <h2>Tips</h2>

    <p class="jenkins-description">
      Donâ€™t rely solely on color to differentiate between objects or communicate important information.
      If your app uses color to convey information, be sure to provide text labels or glyph shapes so
      users with colorblindness or other visual disabilities can understand it.
    </p>

    <p class="jenkins-description">
      The power of color to call attention to important information is heightened when used sparingly.
      For example, a red triangle that warns of a critical problem becomes less effective when red is
      used elsewhere in an app for noncritical reasons.
    </p>

    <p class="jenkins-description">
      When you use a system color for your accent color, you get automatic support for both appearance modes.
