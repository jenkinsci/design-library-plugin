page.description=You can add arbitrary additional items to the breadcrumb bar (see above), and associate menus with them. This mechanism is convenient for adding anchors to a large page and provide quick access to the key parts. A very typical place where you want to do this is in the configuration page. There's a <code>f\:breadcrumb-config-outline</code> tag specifically for this use case, which parses <code>f\:section</code> and use that to build the context menu. See the freestyle job configuration page for an example of using this tag.
section.1.title=Section 1
section.1.description=This is section 1
