description=A flexible list of items, all derived from a shared base type. Users can add as many items as they need \
  and configure each one independently. Each describable class needs to provide a <code>config.jelly</code>.<br/><br/>\
  The submission can be data-bound into <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> where <code>T</code> is the common base \
  type for the describable instances (<code>Entry</code> in the snippet above).<br/><br/> \
  See the documentation of <a href="https://reports.jenkins.io/core-taglib/jelly-taglib-ref.html#repeatableheteroproperty" \
  target="_blank">repeatableHeteroProperty</a> for a complete list of attributes and what they do.\
  <br/>\
  <br/>\
  The example classes shown above are snippets from a parent class that implements the <code>Describable</code> interface. To use these \
  classes, you must define them as inner classes within a parent class that also implements <code>Describable</code>.
