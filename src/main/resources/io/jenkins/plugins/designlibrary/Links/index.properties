title=Navigational context menu integration

blurb=<p class="jdl-paragraph">Jenkins consists of a large and complex graph of domain objects (<code>ModelObject</code>), where each node in the graph is a web page and edges are hyperlinks. \
  To help users navigate quickly on this graph, Jenkins provides a mechanism to attach context menus to model objects, \
  which can be used to hop multiple edges without going through individual hyperlinks.

define.title=Defining context menu

blurb.define=<p class="jdl-paragraph">To define a context menu on <code>ModelObject</code>, implement <a href="https://javadoc.jenkins.io/byShortName/ModelObjectWithContextMenu"><code>ModelObjectWithContextMenu</code></a>. \
  See <a href="sourceFile/NavigationContextMenu.java">the example</a> for how to implement this method.

breadcrumb.title=Breadcrumb integration

blurb.breadcrumb=<p class="jdl-paragraph">Implementing <code>ModelObjectWithContextMenu</code> is sufficient for the core to show the context menu \
  for your model object in the breadcrumb. Hover your mouse over the breadcrumb of this page to see context menu \
  associated with this sample. \
  <p class="jdl-paragraph"> \
  In addition, implementing \
  <a href="https://javadoc.jenkins.io/jenkins/model/ModelObjectWithChildren.html"><code>ModelObjectWithChildren</code></a> \
  enables you to show children of your model object in the breadcrumb when you click the \u2018>\u2019 icon that separates \
  breadcrumb items.

hyperlink.title=Model hyperlink

blurb.modelLink=<p class="jdl-paragraph">By adding CSS class "model-link" to the &lt;a> tags pointing to model objects with context menu, \
  you can enable the context menu support to that hyperlink. For example:

blurb.modelLink.inside=\
  <p class="jdl-paragraph">Unless the hyperlink appears inline, it is often better to pre-allocate a space for the context menu anchor \
  that appears when the mouse hovers over. To do this, also add the "inside" CSS element. For example:


blurb.tltr=<p class="jdl-paragraph">By default, context menu appears below the link ,but this is inconvenient when model links line up in a vertical list. \
  Add additional "tl-tr" CSS class (read it as "top-left of the context menu to top-right of the target anchor") to \
  make context menu appear on the right.
