  <s:sample>
    <p class="jenkins-description">Checkboxes are simple to use in Jenkins with the jelly tag.</p>

    <p class="jenkins-description">Example parameters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>id (optional) - Sets an id for the input, useful for UI testing, one will be generated for you otherwise. Avoid using in repeatable elements as you will end up with duplicate IDs</li>
      <li>default (optional) - Can be used to set the default to true, not generally recommended as this won't affect configuration as code users,
        only use if you want to set a new default when people configure the plugin.</li>
      <li>field - The field of the descriptor to bind to, must be of type <code>boolean</code></li>
      <li>title - The label for the checkbox.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="jenkins-description">There are more parameters available but they are generally not needed and should be avoided.</p>
