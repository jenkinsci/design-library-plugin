description=Jenkins can display dialogs with a simple-to-use JavaAScript API. They serve as \
  replacement for the browser built-in dialogs for <em>alert</em>, <em>prompt</em> and <em>confirm</em>, \
  additionally you can show arbitrary content in a modal or have complete forms in a dialog. As dialogs are \
  executed asynchronously they can't be used as 1:1 replacements for the browser built-ins.
