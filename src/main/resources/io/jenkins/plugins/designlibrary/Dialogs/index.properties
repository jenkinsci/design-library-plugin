description=Jenkins can display dialogs with a simple-to-use JavaScript API. They serve as \
  replacement for the browser built-in dialogs for <em>alert</em>, <em>prompt</em> and <em>confirm</em>, \
  additionally you can show arbitrary content in a modal or have complete forms in a dialog. As dialogs are \
  executed asynchronously they can''t be used as a 1:1 replacements for the browser built-ins.
alerts=Replaces the browser built-in <em>alert(message)</em>. Contrary to the \
  built-in the code will not wait until the user has closed the alert but as long as the alert is \
  shown the user can't do anything else. Clicking outside the dialog will have no effect, the button \
  must be used to close it.<br/> \
  Alerts are usually used to show error messages.
closeme=Click on the "X" in the top right or outside to close me.
prompts=Replaces the browser built-in <em>prompt(message)</em> to query a single value \
  from a user. This returns a promise that allows the script to react when the user has entered the \
  value or aborted. Clicking outside the dialog will have no effect, the buttons \
  must be used to close it. Default <code>minWidth: 400px</code>
confirmations=Replaces the browser built-in <em>confirm(message)</em> to make a user confirm \
  an action. This returns a promise that allows the script to react when the user has confirmed or \
  denied. Clicking outside the dialog will have no effect, the buttons \
  must be used to close it. By default, the OK button gets the text <code>Yes</code>
modals=Presents a popup to the user with arbitrary information. A modal has no buttons \
  at the bottom. Instead, a close button is added to the upper right corner (can also be hidden). \
  The dialog is closed when clicking outside of it.
forms=Shows a form inside a dialog. For proper functionality, do not wrap the template inside \
  a <code>template</code> block as scripts that are included by forms are not loaded immediately in that case.<br/> \
  Do not include buttons to submit, apply or cancel the form. Those are added automatically. Adding buttons to validate \
  things or testing connections is fine.<br/>\
  You can either handle the form directly or submit the form.<br/> \
  By default, the OK button gets the text <code>Submit</code> which is rather generic. Try to use something, that fits \
  the context e.g. <code>Add</code>. Default <code>minWidth: 600px</code>
buttontexts=There are some predefined button texts available that come with translation. You can refer to them with e.g. <code> \
  dialog.translations.apply</code>. You can choose from the following texts:
