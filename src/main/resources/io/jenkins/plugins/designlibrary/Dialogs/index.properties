description=Jenkins can display dialogs with a simple-to-use JavaScript API. They serve as \
  replacement for the browser built-in dialogs for <em>alert</em>, <em>prompt</em> and <em>confirm</em>, \
  additionally you can show arbitrary content in a modal or have complete forms in a dialog. As dialogs are \
  executed asynchronously they can''t be used as a 1:1 replacements for the browser built-ins.
alerts=Replaces the browser built-in <em>alert(message)</em>. Contrary to the \
  built-in the code will not wait until the user has closed the alert but as long as the alert is \
  shown the user can't do anything else. Clicking outside the dialog will have no effect, the button \
  must be used to close it.<br/> \
  Alerts are usually used to show error messages.
closeme=Click on the "X" in the top right or outside to close me.
prompts=Replaces the browser built-in <em>prompt(message)</em> to query a single value \
  from a user. This returns a promise that allows the script to react when the user has entered the \
  value or aborted. Clicking outside the dialog will have no effect, the buttons \
  must be used to close it.
confirmations=Replaces the browser built-in <em>confirm(message)</em> to make a user confirm \
  an action. This returns a promise that allows the script to react when the user has confirmed or \
  denied. Clicking outside the dailog will have no effect, the buttons \
  must be used to close it.
modals=Presents a popup to the user with arbitrary information. A modal has no buttons \
  at the bottom. Instead a close button is added to the upper right corner (can also be hidden). \
  The dialog is closed when clicking outside of it.
forms=Shows a form inside a dialog. For proper functionality, do not wrap the template inside \
  a <code>template</code> block as scripts that are included by forms are not loaded immediately in that case. \
  You can either handle the form directly or submit the form.
