description=Create a heterogeneous list, where the user can choose an arbitrary number of arbitrary \
  items with a common describable base type, and configure them independently. Each describable class \
  needs to provide a <code>config.jelly</code>.<br/>\
  The submission can be data-bound into <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> where T is the common base \
  type for the describable instances (<code>Entry</code> in the snippet below).<br/> \
