description=Create a heterogeneous list, where the user can choose an arbitrary number of arbitrary \
  items with a common describable base type, and configure them independently. Each describable class \
  needs to provide a <code>config.jelly</code>.<br/>\
  The submission can be data-bound into <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> where T is the common base \
  type for the describable instances (<code>Entry</code> in the snippet below).<br/> \
  See the documentation of <a href="https://reports.jenkins.io/core-taglib/jelly-taglib-ref.html#repeatableheteroproperty" \
  target="_blank">repeatableHeteroProperty</a> for a complete list of attributes and what they do.\

  The example classes shown below are snippets from a parent class that implements the Describable interface. To use these \
  classes, you must define them as inner classes within a parent class that also implements Describable.
