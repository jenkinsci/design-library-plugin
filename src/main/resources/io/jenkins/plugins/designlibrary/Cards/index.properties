creating-a-card.description=Cards are designed to automatically expand and fill the available space within their container, making them flexible and easy to use in different layouts. \n\nSince Jenkins doesn''t currently have a built-in grid system, you''ll need to create your own if you want to arrange multiple cards in a grid-like structure. You can do this by utilizing Flexbox or Grid to manage the positioning and spacing of your cards within the parent container.

setting-actions-on-a-card.description=Actions are a great way to show key controls right on your card.
