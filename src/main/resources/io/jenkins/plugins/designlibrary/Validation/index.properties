title=Form field validation can access values of the nearby input controls, \
  which is useful for performing complex context-sensitive form validation. \
  The same technique can be also used for auto-completion, populating combobox/listbox, and so on. \
  The example below is a bit contrived, but all the input elements are named 'name' (for city name and state name), \
  and we use <code><a href="https://javadoc.jenkins.io/hudson/RelativePath.html">@RelativePath</a></code> \
  so that the validation of the state name refers to the capital name, and the validation of the city name refers to the state name.
validation.description=To implement this you need to provide a <code>doCheckXXX</code> method, where XXX is the name of your field. \
  This should return a <code>FormValidation</code> object.
