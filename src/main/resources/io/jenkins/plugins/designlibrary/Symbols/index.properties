title=Jenkins Symbols are an extensive and consistent collection of icons for use in Jenkins and plugins. \
Symbols are intended to be used everywhere a traditional icon would be used, such as in the sidebar, in buttons and in tables. \
Symbols are scalable, support different weights and adapt to the user's theme.
description=Symbols should be used to help a user recognise what a task does at a glance. This means they should be easily \
recognisable and relevant to the task, e.g. a padlock for credentials. \
Don't add symbols to headings, they are distracting, often look out of place and do nothing to help the user.
