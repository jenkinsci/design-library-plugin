Design Library makes it easy for developers to build complex and consistent interfaces using Jenkins UI components

This plugin contains:
- demonstration of UI components available in Jenkins
- snippets of Jelly ready-to-use examples

## Contributing

You can open this project as a [Gitpod workspace](https://www.gitpod.io/) which comes pre-configured with all the tools you will need.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jenkinsci/design-library-plugin)

If you prefer using IntelliJ IDEA, you can setup Gitpod integration with JetBrains Gateway using the instructions on [gitpod.io](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/ides-and-editors/intellij), 
which will open the workspace in IntelliJ IDEA using JetBrains Gateway.

Alternatively clone this project and run `mvn hpi:run`.

Go to the **Design Library** menu item or straight to http://localhost:8080/jenkins/design-library/ and play with UI components.

If you just want to see this plugin in action, then you can also visit the latest version of this plugin in our [Jenkins "weekly" live installation](https://weekly.ci.jenkins.io/design-library/).
