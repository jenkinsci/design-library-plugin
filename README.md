# Jenkins Design Library

TODO update this before merge

This fake plugin shows Jenkins developers how to build user interfaces using Jenkins UI components.

This plugin contains:
- demonstration of UI controls available in Jenkins based on Stapler, Jelly, Groovy, etc.
- snippets of Jelly/Groovy "ready-to-use" examples

## Usage

Run `mvn hpi:run`

Go to the **Design Library** menu item or straight to http://localhost:8080/jenkins/design-library/ and play with UI components.
